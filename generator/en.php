<p>Dear Industrians!</p>
<p>My name's Jochem Jeunen and I am running for president of Industria next year. This year I worked as vice-president in the shadow of the president and now it's time to do my own thing together with my team and assure you guys of an awesome year!</p>
<p>How will we do that? Together with my vice-president, we'll be motivating our team and make sure that everyone's helping out. That's how we'll provide you with some of the best activities in Leuven! On the other hand, important contacts with LOKO, Student Council, Group T, ... can't be neglected and that will also be my responsability.</p>
<p>Of course I'm not doing this alone and I am proud to lead our team together with Sam. Some experienced Industrians, to assure a certain continuity, combined with youthful enthusiasm of our newcomers guarantee an awesome year! I am convinced that E.L.F! is ready to provide you, the students, with a year you will remember for the rest of your student career.</p>
<p>Have fun!<br>
Jochem</p>

<p>This year I was responsible for International relations. It was een awesome post and I got to learn a lot of new people. But next year I will focus on the internal operation of Industria and support my awesome President, Jochem Jeunen. I will make sure the whole team is on the same wavelength and keep up their morale.</p>
<p>Besides that I will also follow up all the different posts and help them in case of any problems. In general, make sure everything runs smooth.</p>

<p>Dear beloved Industrians!</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re Anke and Stef and we&rsquo;ll like to be next year&rsquo;s quaestors (or financial managers)! Whereas Stef has some Industria-experience as an editor & quaestor during the current year, Anke is the newbie who&rsquo;s ready to take matter into her own hands with tons of enthousiasm. Toghether we&rsquo;ll try to run the financial side of our favourite student union.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll make sure that the necessary funding will go to (international-)cantusses, parties (maybe in a new D&eacute;li?) and other activities without ruining our cash-flow. No magic here but some solid money-management!</p>
<p>This way, we&rsquo;ll attempt to make next year an even better one with more freaky experiences and stories to tell your great-grandchilderen!</p>
<p>See you guys during the election week,<br>
Anke &amp; Stef</p>

<p>Dear Students,</p>
<p>I am Maxim Laeveren and I am candidate Ab-actis for Industria. This year I took a part in Business Relations, which taught me a great deal and stimulated my interest in the core of Industria. As Ab-actis, or put in a different way secretary, I will be responsible to follow up meetings and make reports to smooth the communication within the praesidium. In addition to that I will handle Industria&rsquo;s insurances and articles.</p>
<p>But we cannot forget to mention the cooperation system of Industria! I will make sure everyone has got something to do and thatshift rosters get filled in. Also, I&rsquo;m going to try to improve and expand the cooperationsystem and try to get every student motivated to help a hand at one of ouramazing activities. Work hard, party harder!</p>
<p>So vote for E.L.F! if you want an awesome year full of activities where you also could be a part of!</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br>
Maxim</p>

<p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>We are Michiel and Ruben, we are the candidates for entertainment as function for Industria. At this moment, there is no fakbar where we can keep our parties as our legendary &lsquo;Proffentap&rsquo;, &lsquo;Beurscaf&eacute;&rsquo;, &lsquo;Duvel Night&rsquo;,&hellip; But next year our fakbar might be back and then these parties and much more can take place. And what else, what keeps us from partying somewhere else?</p>
<p>Therefore, we will organize next year the necessary cantusses and parties, so you can talk, sing, dance and drink as much as you want. We feel that that&rsquo;s not enough for you, so we will occasionally offer you something to eat and drink in front of Group T. You don&rsquo;t have to move too far to have a nice relaxation between two classes or after class. In short, we want to ensure you that there will be enough entertainment and relaxation.</p>
<p>Remember: recreation is less boring than effort!</p>
<p>Cheers!<br>

<p>Commiltones!</p>
<p>For a fair few years now the amount of freshmen has been steadily increasing and to ensure the follow up with the freshmen is continued we (Dries and Fulco) will be taking on the role of Schachtenmeester together next year.
We both have been wandering around on Group T for quite some time now and we have the necessary experience to guide them and to get them involved with Industria.</p>

<p>We would like the close the gap a bit between the freshmen and Industria to ensure that the future of Industria remains safe.
We will attempt to do this by always being accessible for questions and to get as many freshmen to activities of Industria and being there ourselves aswell.
Of course we will also make sure the traditional activities like freshmen weekend, baptizing, &hellip; will be perfect once more next year.</p>

<p>Give the freshmen what they deserve next year. Vote E.L.F.!</p>

<p>Peace out<br>

<p>Hey future engineers!</p>

<p>Besides the partying and enjoying your student life, you still have to study a little bit to get that highly wanted diploma. For this you need all the right books and that will be our, Pieter Van Petegem and Lotte Verschuere, responsibility next year: The KD.</p>

<p>We have a few goals we want to realize during the year. First we will try to convince the professors to publish their books by us, so you can buy them all at once.</p>
<p>A next problem we would like to solve is the queue: we want to make the queue shorter, or at least we hope to make your time waiting a bit more enjoyable!</p>
